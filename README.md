### Choosing a Jekyll Theme for Your GitHub Page

If you're using GitHub to host your personal website or blog, you might be using Jekyll as your static site generator. Jekyll allows you to easily create and manage a website using plain text files, and there are plenty of pre-made themes available that you can use to customize the look and feel of your site. 

In this guide, we'll go through the steps for choosing a Jekyll theme for your GitHub page.

## Step 1: Determine Your Needs

Before selecting a theme, consider the purpose and content of your GitHub page. Do you need a theme that is focused on blogging or a theme that showcases your portfolio? In this demonstration, I will choose a more concise theme for the resume.

## Step 2: Browse the Supported Jekyll themes

The "GitHub Pages" is a great place to start looking for themes. There are plenty of free themes available that cover a variety of use cases. You can browse the page at [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/themes/).

## Step 3: Review the Theme's Documentation

Once you've found your favourite theme, review the documentation to see if it meets your needs. You can find instructions for installation, configuration, and customization.
